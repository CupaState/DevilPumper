## About my development: 
I recently finished creating a new algorithm for the limiter / compressor, 
which I named **"DevilPumper"**. I made it fully automatic, except for one slider that adjusts the threshold 
and a button that switches circuits. Initially, I conceived it as a competitor to Valley People Dynamite, 
which, in my opinion, does an excellent job of creating "explosive" drums. However, apart from that, 
I tested it on other signals as well, such as vocals, pianos, guitars, and others. Wherever the track needs 
to be given breath, wobble and tightness, my limiter works great. It finds the transients on its own and 
adjusts the attack and release time envelopes to highlight the transients and compress what is in between. 
That is why it can be perceived as a competitor for Valley People Dynamite. It has a huge number 
of advantages over other modern plugins. I will write about them in the fifth paragraph of this letter.

*"In the future, I plan to write a distressor with a similar topology. There are few distressors on the market, so I think this will be a great one."*

## Some of my thoughts
*"Now the means of working with sound have become available to a huge number of people around the world. For this reason, many beginners and self-taught people come to sound engineering. Due to its simplicity, **"DevilPumper"** can be demanded by a much larger number of sound engineers"*
*"We live in a time when one knob plugins are becoming more in demand, but more often than not they do not adjust to the signal and perform a narrow range of tasks. **"DevilPumper"** has solved this problem."*

* The plugin is automatic and has a button for switching the circuit from "limiter" to "compressor" and vice versa.
* Since it is very easy to use, even a beginner can use it. Pull down the threshold slider and enjoy!
* Capable of competing against major players such as Valley People Dyna-mite. However, due to the automatic adjustment of the envelopes, its functionality goes far beyond the processing of drums and becomes essentially universal.
* Compression mode works great on group channels. 
*"Try it on drums, vocals, and even the master bus and you will feel the lows rise, pressure increase, without squeezing the transients."*
* This makes group compression so much easier for those who are just starting to work with sound, there is almost no plugin in this area.
* The same can be said for limiting. Before that, only Valley People could "blow up" drums.
* The algorithm is written to save as much of the expensive RAM resources as possible.
* Great for parallel compression
* Does not color the sound.
* Has no delay and can be used in live performances
